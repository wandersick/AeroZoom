New to AeroZoom? To get started, hold [Left] mouse button and wheel up to zoom. While zoomed, press and hold the middle button to preview full screen. Press [Left] and [Middle] mouse buttons to reset zoom. Press [Left] and [Right] to show/hide the panel. Read 'Quick Instructions' via the help menu for more controls.
Despite rigorous testing before release, there could still be bugs due to so many features being introduced in this version. Please, if you find any, leave a comment via 'AeroZoom on the Web' to let WanderSick know.
Did you know the empty areas (e.g. borders) on the AeroZoom panel can be dragged? Let's call the panel by Left+Right mouse buttons and try it now!
Not sure what a function on the panel is for? Hover the mouse cursor over any buttons or items and a short explanation will probably show.
Left-handed users may wish to try the new right-button mode by clicking 'Right' on the panel. It has replaced the separate program (AeroZoom_LeftHand.exe) in older versions.
The middle-button mode is capable of zooming with just one button. Click 'Middle' on the panel to switch. The hotkeys are slightly different though. Be sure to take a look at the end of 'Tool > Quick Instructions'
The borders of the AeroZoom Pad (aka Misclick-preventing Pad) can be totally removed in 'Tool > Advanced Options'. But then it would be almost invisible. If you want, also increase its transparency value to make it more visible.
In case AeroZoom behaves weird as settings are messed up. Use this secret hotkey to reset AeroZoom to default settings: Win+Shift+Alt+R. It is the same as doing a restoration in 'Tools > Advanced Options'.
AeroZoom can be an assistive tool for the disabled. For example, If someone prefers an color-inverted screen after the computer boots up. Invert the color in AeroZoom and select 'Tool > Run on Startup'. Then that PC will always starts with all colors inverted. By the way, press Win+Alt+I to toggle the color inversion.
Did you know AeroZoom can be a handy screen-capturing tool? A new capture can be triggered by holding the middle mouse button or clicking the Snip button on the panel, thanks to Snipping Tool. It allows us to select any region of the screen for annotation. (Mac users who loves Command+Shift+4 or Linux Compiz users who love Winkey+dragging to capture regions of screen should like it)
Mac users may know this hotkey: Command+Option+Control+8 to make screen color negative. The AeroZoom-equivalent is Win+Alt+I.
'Preview Full Screen' is useful in case you've zoomed in somewhere and want to jump to another part quickly without zooming out first. AeroZoom 2.0 lets you triggers a full screen preview by holding the Middle mouse button.
Holding the middle button triggers 2 different actions dynamically. While zoomed in, 'Preview Full Screen' is triggered to preview other areas of the screen; while zoomed out, the 'still zoom' of 'Sysinternals ZoomIt' is triggered to allow for non-live zooming and drawing. If ZoomIt is not enabled, a new snip of Snipping Tool is triggered.
Do you always unintendedly trigger the snip/still-zoom/preview function of the middle mouse button? If you do, please increase the threshold in 'Tool > Advanced Options' to delay it.
If, for some reasons, you don't want AeroZoom to trigger snip/still-zoom/preview while holding the middle mouse button triggers, you can easily disabe it in 'Tool > Hold Middle as Trigger'.
Love AeroZoom? Want to recommend it to a friend? Why not to install it to your/his local computer? Just go to 'Tool > Install to this Computer'. The installation is per-user and does not require administrator rights.
For unattended or all-user installation (i.e. into the 'Program Files' folder), see Setup.exe /?
If you have a mouse with Back/Forward buttons, you may use either mouse button as a modifier. While not giving up the original Back/Forward functions, AeroZoom also makes use of the extra button to provide more features. What is an extra button? If you use the Forward button (F) as the modifier, then the extra button would be the Back button and vice versa. Please take a read '? > Quick Instructions > Extra' on what AeroZoom is capable of.
Often you may want to find out how far you've zoomed or how much more you can zoom. Open the AeroZoom panel and switch to Magnification slider from the 'Az' menu. As you zoom in/out, the slider updates in real-time to indicate at which zoom level you are at. In addition, if you have a mouse with Back/Forward buttons and are using those modes (modifiers), likewise, switch to Zoom Increment slider from the 'Az' menu. As you wheels up or down, the new level is reflected on the slider immediately.
Where is the [Show] button we used to click to bring up the magnifier? [Mag] has superseded the [Show] button in this version as it can dynamically provide both 'show' and 'hide' functions, so it was renamed to reflect the changed.
Besides clicking [Mag], try pressing Win+Shift+` (the key below Esc) to show or hide the magnifier.
Have you discovered a bug or got a suggestion? Please help improve AeroZoom by reporting it via '? > AeroZoom on the Web'. Thank you!
The [Kill] button is now deprecated and disabled by default because 1) to stop a magnifier in action, [Reset] can be used. 2) To hide the floating magnifier window and icon, just click [Mag] again.
If you use Lens or Docked views a lot, you may find the [Kill] button useful. It can be enabled in Tools > Advanced.
There are lots of ways to show or hide the panel: 1) Double-clicking on AeroZoom's tray icon. 2) Pressing Win+Shift+ESC. 3) Left+Right mouse buttons. 4) Modifier key/button+Right mouse button
Did you know that the panel can now be triggered by both holding the Left mouse button then press Right, and first holding the Right then press Left? All modes (modifiers) supports this method.
Click-n-Go -- clicking any button on the panel causes the panel to hide as well -- was the behaviour of older AeroZoom versions that is now turned off by default because it is harder for beginners. After you've got used to using AeroZoom you may wish to turn it on in 'Tool' menu to maximize productivity.
To add or decrease time for the break timer of Sysinternals ZoomIt, use the mouse wheel or arrow keys.
Did you know you can draw or type when zooming using Sysinternals ZoomIt? Just left-click anywhere to draw, press T to type! You want a black board? Press K. Need a white one? Press W. Undo an edit? Press Ctrl+Z. Erase everything? Press E. To save a screen shot to clipboard? Press Ctrl+C. To save as PNG? Press Ctrl+S. For more functions, see '? > Quick Instructions > ZoomIt'
Did you know the pen color of Sysinternals ZoomIt can be changed not only via the ZoomIt Options? While drawing/zooming using ZoomIt, just press of the following keys R,G,B,O,P,Y. Yes, you guessed it. They stand for Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Pink, Yellow.
Did you know the font size of Sysinternals ZoomIt can be changed not only via the ZoomIt Options? While in text mode, scroll using the mouse wheel or use the arrow keys.
Never press Alt+F4 to leave the active window of ZoomIt; otherwise ZoomIt.exe might hang leaving a phantom process. Instead, press Esc key, right click, or hold the middle mouse button.
Miss the classic AeroZoom interface? Try the mini mode in 'AZ > Switch to Mini Mode'
'Always on top' is applied to AeroZoom panel as well as [Calc] and [Type]. Turning off 'Always on Top' in the 'Tool' menu immediately disable the 'Always on Top' flag as well on those types of window that already exist; turning on does not make them 'always on top' again, however, unless you run those apps again.
Keyboard shortcuts are supported for lots of tasks, press [Alt] on the panel to see them. For global shortcuts, see 'Quick Instructions' in the help menu.
Sometimes it is convenient to temporarily disable (toggle) the mouse hotkeys. There are 2 ways: 1) Click 'off' on the panel. 2) Press Win+Alt+S. The keyboard hotkeys are not disabled however. To disable all hotkeys, right-click on the tray icon, select 'Suspend Hotkeys'.
Zoom Pad may not be accurate for some types of window. That's why you may want to fine-tune it in 'Tool > Advanced Options'.
If you want, Zoom Pad can stay a little longer by increasing the time in 'Tool > Advanced Options'. If you do so you will also find that the whole pad can be dragged, not only the title bar.
Besides presentations, another usage is capturing screen videos for tutorial purpose. Where normally you'd need a lot of work to zoom in with professional video editors such as Adobe Premiere. With AeroZoom, simply zoom in with the magnifier hidden during recording, and it's done. No post-production required.
An undocumented function: pressing a chosen mode (modifier) button and right button will trigger the panel as well as Left+Right mouse buttons (e.g. If the mode/modifier is Ctrl, it would be Ctrl+Right click). This is provided as a backup for cases where left-clicks may be totally unacceptable to some apps even with the Misclick-preventing Pad (AeroZoom Pad) on. Unfortunately this tip only applies to right-handed users. It also does not apply to the middle button mode (modifier) as its hotkeys are slightly different.
The main difference between Running Calulator, Paint, Notepad/Wordpad from the panel buttons [Calc], [Paint], [Type] and running from the 'Tool > Windows Tools' menu is: 1. The former can be customized in Advanced Options. 2. The former are affected by the 'Always on Top' setting. 3. If an existing window is found, the former will switch to it instead.
Do you find Misclick-preventing Pad (aka AeroZoom Pad) slow for your computer? You may decrease its size to speed it up in 'Tool > Advanced Options', or increase it if more coverage is wanted.
For performance reasons, it is not suggested to close Magnifier manually. Instead, use the 'Mag' or 'Reset' buttons on the panel whenever possible.
When 'Follow Keyboard' is on, Misclick-preventing Pad (aka AeroZoom Pad) may not work well. It is suggested to use 'Follow Text' instead.
AeroZoom settings are stored in the registry for both the portable and installed versions instead of .ini files. If you bring AeroZoom to another computer, the settings will be lost. This is by design because each PC has their own optimal settings.
Want to speed up the operation after pressing buttons on the panel? You may set 'Button delay' in 'Tool > Advanced Options' to a lower value before the button refuses to work. Tweaking is required to find out the best value for your system.
Pressing buttons on the AeroZoom panel has no effect at times? You may have to set 'Button delay' in 'Tool > Advanced Options' to a higher value for your system.
Do you find any issues while using AeroZoom? Maybe it is a known issue. Read the [Limitation] section of the Readme at '? > About > Readme' or 'AeroZoom on the Web' for workarounds.
Limitation: 'Run on Startup' fails to automatically run magnifier on startup if there are UAC prompts caused by other programs during boot.
Limitation: After using AeroZoom, Magnifier cannot be launched separately. Solution: In Tool > Advanced Options, change 'Magnifier window' to Minimize/Show.
Limitation: The Magnification slider gets jerky or does not work. Try to avoid using keyboard hotkeys to zoom and see if it improves.
